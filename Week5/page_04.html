        <h2>
          1. Light Entry: The process of vision begins when light enters the eye
          through the cornea, which is the clear, protective outer covering of
          the eye. The cornea helps to focus light onto the lens.
          <br /><br />
          2. Lens Focus: The lens is a flexible structure located behind the
          cornea. It adjusts its shape to fine-tune the focus of incoming light
          onto the retina at the back of the eye. The ability of the lens to
          change shape is known as accommodation, and it allows us to focus on
          objects at different distances.
          <br /><br />
          3. Retina and Photoreceptors: The retina is the innermost layer of the
          eye, akin to the film in a camera. It contains millions of specialized
          light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors, specifically rods and
          cones.
