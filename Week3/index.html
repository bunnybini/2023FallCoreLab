        <h2>
          This quote made me think deeply because it tells me that making
          websites doesn't have to be about having big goals or specific plans.
          What I like about this quote is that it encourages a more relaxed and
          open approach to making websites. It's like saying, "You don't always
          need a clear purpose or a set goal when creating a website." This idea
          feels freeing because it goes against the idea that everything we do
          online has to have a strict purpose or measurable success.

          The concept of a website is like a treasure trove of random words:
          room, shelf, plant, or garden, all neatly contained under the umbrella
          term "Web." At first glance, we might simplistically view a website as
          a visual representation of links, but the reading in question takes us
          on a profound journey, delving deep into the very essence of what a
          "website" truly means.
          <br /><br />
          Schwulst's metaphor of websites as plants resonates deeply with me.
          Just as a gardener carefully tends to their plants, we, as creators,
          nurture our websites with attention and care. We choose the right
          environment, cultivate content, and foster interactions. Much like
          planting a seed and watching it grow into a thriving garden, the
          process of website creation is a labor of love that requires patience,
          dedication, and a touch of artistry.
          <br /><br />
          But what truly captivates me is the idea that websites are not static
          or fixed in purpose. They are, like living organisms, subject to
          evolution and change. A website can start as a simple idea seed and
          blossom into something entirely unexpected. It may evolve with time,
          responding to the shifting tides of user engagement and technological
          advancements.
