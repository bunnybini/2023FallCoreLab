      <h1>"CYBER DISTANCE"</h1>
      <br />
      <h3 class="pargraph">
        In the reading from the "Critical Atlas of the Internet," it is
        mentioned that in the digital realm of the internet, the concept of
        distance undergoes a profound transformation. The internet erases
        physical distances, making everything just a click away. In this
        context, the traditional notion of spatial distance becomes irrelevant,
        as the architecture of the internet is controlled by search engines.
        However, I have a question regarding this idea of the "distance of the
        internet." I do agree that traditional spatial distance is not relevant
        in cyberspace compared to our physical world.

        <br />
        Still, there exists another form of distance that we observe and
        encounter: time. It's the time it takes to access digital content. In
        our real-life experiences as internet users, we perceive this time as
        our personal <b>"cyber distance."</b> While the internet eliminates the
        constraints of physical space, the human experience within it is defined
        by the passage of time. In practical terms, we may not measure distances
        in clicks as we do in the physical world, but we do gauge our virtual
        journeys by the seconds it takes to load a webpage or the moments spent
        waiting for a video to buffer. These seemingly brief intervals are our
        tangible experience of digital space. These moments where we wait for
        content to load are the instances when the internet, despite its
        vastness, becomes tangible to us as users. <br /><br /><br />
        It's this interplay between the instantaneous access to information and
        the milliseconds of waiting that defines our relationship with the
        internet. The search engines, acting as the architects of this virtual
        universe, wield the power to distribute and manipulate space based on
        our needs, shaping our perception of distance, both in the real and
        virtual sense. Therefore, as we navigate through the vast landscape of
        the internet, it's crucial to recognize that while it renders physical
        distances obsolete, it introduces a new dimension where time becomes the
        currency. Each click we make carries the weight of these moments, and
        it's within this subtle dance between immediacy and anticipation that we
        find ourselves exploring the captivating and ever-expanding world of the
        internet.
        <br /><br /><br />
        In light of these reflections, I have created a webpage designed to
        visually represent this concept of "internet distance" by showcasing the
        time it takes to access different links. The measured time can be seen
        as a representation of our "cyber distance," which can vary depending on
        internet or Wi-Fi settings. The webpage features a stopwatch that
        initiates when a search begins and stops when the content is fully
        loaded, providing a tangible representation of the milliseconds of
        waiting we experience in this digital space.
