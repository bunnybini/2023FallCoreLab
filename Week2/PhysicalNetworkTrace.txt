This location can be found right beside the City Hall Park which is a public park surrounding New York City Hall in the Civic Center of Manhattan. 

- Who built it?

In 1802 the site was selected for the new City Hall designed by John McComb and Frances Magnin, the land developed into a formal park. 
McComb designed an iron fence with marble piers topped by lamps for the park's perimeter in 1820. 

- fun fact
City Hall Park is one of those rare quarters of New York â€“ a green space that has remained green since it was first laid down by the city planners.

5. England/London (51.50853, -0.12574)
From my perspective, I believe this location is near Charing Cross in the UK, close to Duncannon Street. According to the map, it appears to be a subway station.

This place is the center of the city, with a crowded restaurant scene, as one might expect. 

-Fun fact
The restaurant 'Halfway To Heaven,' right next to Charing Cross, hosts a fantastic matinee drag show every Saturday.
