One of the unusual practices at the time was the "Shaving Parade." Every year on May 1st, a parade would take place in which livestock was paraded around the park, and their wool was shaved off right there. This wool was then auctioned to the highest bidder. It was quite a spectacle, and the Shaving Parade was a significant event in early New York City!</p>
