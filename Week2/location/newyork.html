            <div class="collumn"><div class="head"><span class="headline hl1">City Hall Park used to be a place for <span class="headline hl3">'Shaving Parade'</span></span></div>One fun fact about City Hall Park is that it has a rich history and has seen its fair share of notable events. n the 18th century, before it became a park, the site now occupied by City Hall Park was used as a public market known as the "New York Commons." One of the unusual practices at the time was the "Shaving Parade." Every year on May 1st, a parade would take place in which livestock was paraded around the park, and their wool was shaved off right there. This wool was then auctioned to the highest bidder. It was quite a spectacle, and the Shaving Parade was a significant event in early New York City!</p>
